Simple blockchain using Python
I learned this from a udemy course (Blockchain A-Z) and tried my version of blockchain using python.

For code to work install:

 -Flask==0.12.2 : pip install Flask==0.12.2
 
 -postman HTTP client :https://www.getpostman.com/
 
By refering or trying this code you can get better understanding of Gensis block, Mining, Proof of work, Hashing,Flask and etc.
